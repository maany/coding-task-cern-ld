# Python coding challenge

Welcome to our python coding challenge!

## The landscape challenge

This python coding challenge consists of two parts:
- Part 1: Handling the landscape data
- Part 2: The mountain area algorithm

Instructions on how to complete the individual parts are available in the [python directory](./python/).

## Deliverables

Once you have completed the challenge, run the `build-deliverables.sh` script to build the `solution.zip` archive.

If for some reason you cannot run this script, please make an archive that contains the content from the python directory (./python) and name this archive `solution.zip`.

Then, send us your archive following the instructions we gave you by email.


## Time

Besides the general deadline, there is no hard time limit for either of the parts. However, you are asked to specify the time spent on each part when you submit your results (see email instructions).

If you don't have time to complete a part and you see that there is still room for improvement, please describe verbally the steps that you would take to complete the remaining tasks. You can use the `comments.txt` file for this purpose.
