1. check if area algorithm can handle mountain ranges separated by some x-distance.
2. add test cases for area calculation outside of the example provided.
3. fix rendering i.e. __str__ function of mountain/trees or landscape.
4. metaclass auto-registration does not works in tests, but not when executing main.py,
   This is due to the fact that when we run main.py, we need to force loading of AbstractEntity objects before
   Landscape objects. This can be done by adding a metaclass for Landscape class and loading AbstractEntities over there.
5. add proper documentation
6. fix flake8 errors
7. test the dynamic programming function for multiple levels of attribute dependencies.
8. add a permormance timer and measure algorithm runtimes.
